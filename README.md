# CSIS691_Final-Project
Machine Learning Project Final submission.  Abstract— Utilizing the CIC-DDoS2019, this project highlights the potential of neural networks to advance anomaly detection systems.


Abstract— In the domain of cybersecurity, the rapid detection and mitigation of network anomalies are critical for maintaining the integrity and performance of network infrastructures. Traditional detection systems often struggle with modern cyber threats' dynamic and increasingly sophisticated nature, mainly distributed denial-of-service attacks. This project evaluates Neural Networks' efficacy as a network anomaly detection and identification method. Utilizing the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset developed by the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity at the University of New Brunswick, this project implemented a methodology encompassing data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature selection aimed at building a Neural Network that is capable of network anomaly detection and later network anomaly identification. My conclusions demonstrate that neural networks are a way of detecting network anomalies.
